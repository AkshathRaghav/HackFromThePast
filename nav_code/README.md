# nav_code 

The time was 1943. You and your friend Rukhmini are in a British Navy ship when a member of the navy approaches you with a curious looking box. She recognizes it as an enigma box and is used by the Germans to code and encrypt messages. This particular contraption  is a simple alphabet shift encoding system where each alphabet gets promoted by a certain value. Your objective is to decode the encrypted text provided to you. Assume that all characters other than spaces are encrypted.


Sample input:
1) [ol wyvnyht zov|sk il mhz{ huk lmmpjplu{
2) h\ip\ggt ^m\^fdib ocdn ^j_` dnio q`mt _daad^pgo ]po dn odh` ^jinphdib
3) g[\f f[bh_Wag gT^X `beX g[Ta gjXagl `\ahgXf

Sample output: 
1) The program should be fast and efficient
2) Manually cracking this code isnt very difficult but is time consuming
3) This shouldnt take more than twenty minutes

Assume letters can only be encrypted to other letters or symbols and that the letter promote works on ASCII codes. You are free to use any libraries of your choice. (A library of words in the english dictionary could be helpful)
