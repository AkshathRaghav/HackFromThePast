# Stack Challenge 

In the Stack Challenge, you are provided with 3 rods and `x` discs, which are stacked over one another in increasing order of sizes. Your objective is to move the stack from Rod A to Rod C under the condition that only the top disc from each stack can be moved one at a time and at no point can there be a larger disc over a smaller one. <br> <br> 

Assume the rods are named as A, B and C respectively.

**Input Format** 

x, which is a single integer for the number of rings on the first stack

For example, 1 : A --> C

**Sample Input 0**

```
3
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
1 : A --> C
2 : A --> B
